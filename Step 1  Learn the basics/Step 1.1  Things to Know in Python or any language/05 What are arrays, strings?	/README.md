# What are arrays, strings?

## String( Ex - ‘karan’, “karan”, ‘’’karan‘’’’ )

String in Python are arrays of bytes representing Unicode characters. A string is a collection of one or more characters put in a single quote, double-quote, or triple-quote. In python there is no character data type.

> Triple-Quote also use for adding multiline comments

```python
# with single Quotes
String1 = 'Welcome'

# with double Quotes
String1 = "to"

# with triple Quotes
String1 = '''Code And Geek'''

#Triple Quotes allows multiple lines
String1 = '''Code
			And
			Geek'''
```

## Array/List ( Ex - [ 1, 2, 3, “hello”, 4, 5, 6 ] )

List are just like arrays, declared in other languages which is an ordered collection of data. It is very flexible as the items in a list do not need to be of the same type.

```python
List = ["hello", 1, 2, 3, True, 4, 5]
for item in List:
  print(item)
```
